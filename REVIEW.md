# PR Review Notes

## Summary
- Confirmed the WhatsApp floating button now sits closer to the viewport edges and uses a consistent 48px square footprint for better touch targets.

## Concerns
- Project linting currently fails due to existing issues in Contact.jsx, Navbar.jsx, and SectionHeader.jsx. These should be addressed to restore a clean lint status.
